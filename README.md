For this project, I took an approach of first reviewing the README, then I broke down the three required components.  The first was to fix a hyperlink, the next was to clean up the CSS, and then provide notes.  I reviewed the css file and consolidated the code so that it has less lines and I brighten the logo to make it pop out better.
